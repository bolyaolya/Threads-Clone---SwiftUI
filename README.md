## Introduction

This project is a clone of Threads app. I combined SwiftUI for the user interface, Firebase for backend functionalities, and Kingfisher for image loading and caching.

This Threads Clone project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Threads or any associated entities. It is created for educational purposes and as a demonstration of SwiftUI and Firebase integration.

## Features

* User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and securely authenticate their accounts;
* Thread Creation;
* User Profiles;
* Real-time Updates: Enjoy real-time updates when new threads or posts are created.
